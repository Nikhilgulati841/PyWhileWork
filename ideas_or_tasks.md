**NOT DONE**

In **pandas_dataframe_timeslots.py**

**Disclaimer 1-->** Ask for time slots and ask 7 or till user
did not want to stop using while or for loop, whichever suits you.

**Disclaimer 2-->** Make this data printed as a schedule.csv or xlsx as schedule 1, Schedule 2 or Date 1, Date 2 (Learn Read and write to the file using python)

**Disclaimer 3-->** Use the append method to store N number of time slots and also to update and delete use the list.

**Disclaimer 3-->** As soon as you have typed all your Slots, Display it also. So, 1 `<sup>`st `</sup>` Table for Time Slot display & 2 `<sup>`nd `</sup>` for Full Schedule Display.

**Disclaimer 4-->** Make def functions for **ias={tslots,full_schedule,update:(tslots,dt(defined tasks)),delete-a slot (dt_data.drop(tslotslist[user_input_S.No-1]),rename}** and then the name of the def function in the dictionary and ask the user, if the user wanted to add the timeslots, defined tasks, reminders|Help. Then call the action taken by the user as ias[update], ias[full_schedule]

**1-->**  df = df.rename(columns={'A': 'X', 'B': 'Y'}) or| df.rename(columns={'A': 'X'}, index={'X': 'W'}, inplace=True) or| df.index.name = 'Index_Name'

1--> Use User input to ask for **Time Slots** as t1,t2,t3... t7 or user input until user want's to stop

2--> Same as above, ask user to enter the **Defined Tasks** as d1,d2,d3... same number as **Time Slots**

3--> Same goes with **Reminders** as r1,r2... same number as **Time Slots**

4--> Use data_dict={"Time Slots":[t1,t2,t3,...],"Defined Tasks":[d1,d2,d3....],"Reminders":[r1,r2,r3....]}

**Second Normal approach** --> Typing in the schedule simply to the dictionary

**FINAL APPROACH-->**

- [X] An Empty list to ask for timeslots, append the time slot in it.
- [X] For the Defined Tasks, append("Update it..") | then Display the Table with the dict data.
- [X] Two new list for storing Defined Tasks and Help for that. Ask it using a loop as number of times as the number of timeslots (len(timeslots))
- [X] Display, listname means using list name and not the values, display the full schedule.
- [X] Make a new function, (update_full_schedule).
- [ ] Make all the functions for (Add|Delete|)
- [ ] Make Choices with the fucntions name.
- [ ] Make a major choice which asks for the New Schedule & Update current Schedule.
- [ ] Add date time for the file to save with.
- [ ] Keep all the current Schedules and while updating Two options (Update to the same Sheet:Same name will help | New Sheet:New Name)
- [ ] Try .csv or .xlsx file to access or to update DataFrames into the .csv file, so to access it later. (If not getting the options to Save New & Update the Current file)

**NOT DONE**

In **A New File of Python**

use the CSV or xlsx file to retrieve the data from it and use it in python using the pandas **DataFrame** or any other library. maybe this is in the **Python TuteDude course**

**NOT DONE**

Get the wifi names and the passwords for all the wifi connected to the laptop using python

---

**NOT DONE**

get your **ideas_while_work.md** file copy paste in your **JFoldknewme.docx** file saved in Drive and see what happens.

**NOT DONE** Tasks of the DAY **(16/11/2024)**
You can sometimes directly copy paste from **ideas_or_tasks.md**

1. **DONE** Gather all your sources, that you access and work on. Make a **Linked Diagram** all. -stored PW -Daily Understanding docs -Programs saved -physical memory -Online memory -Git Memory(**Nikhilgulati841**) --Git Repositories for testing & Completed Projects | Programs (**_PyWhileWork_** & **JFoldknewme**) --daily ideas or tasks while Work(**ideasortasks_while_work.md**) *[Daily Understanding.docx & a Git file daily_understanding.md]*  In short, you have automated your task and include Mess Time Table also.  (0.5 hrs)

You were my fav person, you still is my fav person that I wanted always to go back with.
but it feels like I was placed on a 1000 degree fire, that too without my will.
No matter what I do, I do not have a choice to jump out of it, I will have to stand still on that fire.The way you disconnects with me, and the way you treated me, like I was not one to you.
The way you placed a big Bar between us
I tried a lot to break that bar, but every time I tried, I fall off from that, and got hurt the same way as I was when you decided to leave.I wasn't able to bear those major bruises till now and how much more time it will take, I don't know.
Seeing, how easily you forgets all the goods and the feelings that I had for you and decided never to have a life with me and giving a thought of getting arranged after some time.. Within 3 months you are so much over me that you can think this way.While you can think of these things but I am still suffering and dealing with lots and lots of things to get over you, but I am not able to. I guess you will never understand with how much I am going through everyday and what happens to me when you come up to my mind, without my will and knowing that you are not around and you will never be. I think you will always be in my head and gives me lots and lots of pain but you will never give me a chance, your zombie a chance to WIN you back.I think, the way you left me alone when I needed you the most, you should leave me alone again and let me go through all the pain and with your thoughts coming to my mind with a speed of 100 kmph 24 hrs all days a week, month or maybe a year. Which I am not able to bear.
Sometimes, I think, this is too much to deal with all the things I am going through,then again a thought came up,
that No one Stood by my side, when I was falling apart and no one will ever.
So, I guess I will see If I standalone or fall apart
but I will walking alone is the only option I see here now.
As I have already reached multiple times seeking for a person that will always be with me but then I fail again.So, I am tired of trying now...I think, the way you left me alone earlier:-Pooja: Thook ke NAHI chathti mai,
Pooja: Nikhil tera baat krne ka mann kar ra hai Mera NAHI,
Pooja: Baar Baar call Kroge toh mai BLOCK kar dungi,
Nikhil: please rukk jaao I NEED YOU
Pooja: No, I don't need you, do whatever you wish but I am leaving.
Pooja: Mujhe nhi rehena Tere saath
Pooja: Vo Vibe NAHI aati Tere saath ab
Pooja: Mujhe break chahiye (multiple times)
NIKHIL asked: Haath pakad ke khada hu, I still need you. I will not be able to bear if you left.
POOJA Replied: Haath patak/jhatak/chuda ke jaa ri hu, zabardasti hi shi but aakhir Kaar Haath chuda Liya hai.
I don't need you, Mai Marna pasand karungi but tumhare Saath rehena bear nhi kar paaungi.It's time to leave me alone the same way, I will not bother anyone's life. As y'all didn't want me in your life at some point of your time. So, y'all will not see me around...
