In **pandas_dataframe_timeslots.py**

**Disclaimer 1-->** Ask for time slots and ask 7 or till user 
did not want to stop using while or for loop, whichever suits you.

**Disclaimer 2-->** Make this data printed as a schedule.csv or xlsx as schedule 1, Schedule 2 or Date 1, Date 2 (Learn Read and write to the file using python)

**Disclaimer 2-->** Use the append method to store N number of time slots and also to update and delete use the list.

1--> Use User input to ask for **Time Slots** as t1,t2,t3... t7 or user input until user want's to stop

2--> Same as above, ask user to enter the **Defined Tasks** as d1,d2,d3... same number as **Time Slots**

3--> Same goes with **Reminders** as r1,r2... same number as **Time Slots**

4--> Use data_dict={"Time Slots":[t1,t2,t3,...],"Defined Tasks":[d1,d2,d3....],"Reminders":[r1,r2,r3....]}

use the CSV or xlsx file to retrieve the data from it and use it in python using the pandas **DataFrame** or any other library. maybe this is in the **Python TuteDude course**
